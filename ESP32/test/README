## test_embedded
Runs test cases on the device. 
Therefore the port has to be configured in the platformio.ini in the board environment. 


## test_native
The native tests that can be run without the device.
No assumptions of the build chain are made, therefore gcc must run on the host machine.
As this runs on the host, framework libraries are not used and therefore fakes and mocks are used to simulate it.
This uses the native environment in the platformio.ini.

## Usage

To run all test simply run in the platformIO CLI:
```bash
pio test
```

To run a specifiv enviroment run one of these commands:
```bash
pio test -e native
pio test -e esp32-s3-devkitc-1
```

To run a specific test in the native enviroment run:
```bash
pio test -a "--gtest_filter=DummyTest.ShouldPass"
```

To run a specific test in the embedded enviroment change the filter in the main to the test name, e.g.:
```C++
  ::testing::GTEST_FLAG(filter) = "DummyTest.ShouldPass";
```

Unit Testing is a software testing method by which individual units of
source code, sets of one or more MCU program modules together with associated
control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to
determine whether they are fit for use. Unit testing finds problems early
in the development cycle.

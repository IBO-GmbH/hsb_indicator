# Internationalization (i18n)

## how it works
when the project gets build the file `mold/gui/translations/mold_de.ts` gets updated with the sentences from c++. So everything in the designer or everything that looks like `tr("some text")` will be copied for translation to the `mold_de.ts`

## translate
- find the tool `linguist`. Eg under `qt/online/5.11.1/gcc_64/bin`
- open with the tool the file `mold/gui/translations/mold_de.ts`
    - or open the file `mold/gui/translations/mold_de.ts` with a text editor.

## Issues
when you rebuild or clear the project the `mold_de.ts` will get deleted. this is a cmake issue. So ensure that, after you translated anything, that you commit the changes. To prevent accidental losses.
